# Tiny Tensor Library (TTL)

TTL is designed to be a lightweight and easy to use library for tensors. 
This is achieved by supporting only one datatype, F32.
The library tries to support _most_ of what numpy APIs, with the goal to use this library as the backend for a full python library in its v2.
